Install node.js if not already done so https://nodejs.org/en/download
Pull repo down from git
Open cmd and navigate to mta-oba-react wherever your local git repo is
Install react via cmd running "npm install react react-dom" (no quotes)
Execute "npm run start"
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/?LineRef=B63 in your browser
Theoretically this should work!
