            <p>Check MTA Bus Time at the bus stop on your Android, iPhone, Blackberry or other smartphone by visiting <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/">https://bustime.mta.info/</a> in your mobile web browser or by scanning a QR code at a bus stop. This is also an accessibility-friendly text-only version of Bus Time.</p>
            <p><em>* Note: Bus Time is free to use but your mobile carrier charges may apply.</em></p>
            <p>There are a number of ways to search for your stop with the MTA Bus Time mobile web and accessibility-friendly text-only interface:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#gps">By Your Smartphone's GPS</a></li>
              <li><a href="#stopcode">By Stop Code</a></li>
              <li><a href="#route">By Route</a></li>
              <li><a href="#intersection">By Intersection</a></li>
              <li><a href="#zipcode">By ZIP Code</a></li>

            <p>You can use the GPS functionality on your smartphone to search for stops near your current location. Select either the Nearby Stops or Nearby Routes links at top. Your phone's browser may prompt you to permit MTA Bus Time to use the phone's current location.</p>
            <p>Once your location is found, MTA Bus Time will search for bus stops or bus routes nearby. The result is similar to a <a href="#intersection">search by intersection.</a></p>

            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="page-content card">
